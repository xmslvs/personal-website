                    Writing this from my dormitory room; it's my 8th day on campus now, and I think I've gotten used to the atmosphere a bit.
                    <br>
                    Tomorrow's my first day of class. CS106A, please be something I can handle; that's all I'm asking for for this quarter. I'm taking quite a few courses,
                    actually, maybe even a little <i>too</i> much. CS106A, SLE91, ORALCOMM115, RELIGST12N; all of these seem so interesting to me, and I'm excited to see 
                    what I have to learn! (Hopefully they'll be more fun than my high school classes, no offense to my high school teachers though; they were awesome.)
                    <br>
                    With this being the first time in nearly 7 years that I've moved to an unfamiliar environment, I think I've handled the change pretty well - I've made
                    new friends, I've gotten to know the people in charge (I love the RAs here) a bit, and I've done all of this at my own pace, which is the most important
                    part of it all. Once classes start, who knows how stressed I'll be; hopefully, I'll keep on doing things at my own pace, though. 
                    <br>
                    The image in this post is part of the Rodin collection on campus. The sheer amount of art here is amazing, and I think I'll save some time (and energy) to 
                    go look at the various art exhibits on campus at some point.

                    I've gotten used to life in the US. Prices don't feel insane, portions are manageable (although still too large), and I've adjusted to the way people 
                    talk to each other.
                    <br>
                    The past 7 weeks have been just exciting. I visited the tourist-y spots of San Francisco, New Haven (I loved Yale campus), and Boston. 
                    I've learned more than I have in the past few years combined. I've picked up authors like William James (many thoughts about him), and have read 
                    classics like Homer's <i>Odyssey</i> and Sophocles' <i>Antigone</i>.
                    <br>
                    I've also re-learned the basic concepts of programming. Be it the basic types of data like lists, arrays, dictionaries, going over them has 
                    refreshed my memory and has made me excited to learn more in-depth. Having spent the past few years not really learning what I wanted to, 
                    this is a nice change of topic, to something I'm actually invested in learning. 
                    <br>
                    I've started to do debate again - purely as a hobby, and in two completely new formats (BP and APDA). Learning these has been challenging, and I 
                    feel like I'm much less skilled than the others around me, but it's not discouraged me. On the contrary, seeing the skill of people here has made 
                    it so much more fun to push myself to do more. I've also started to play North American Taiko - a mix of tradiitonal Japanese <i>wadaiko</i> and 
                    American influences like blues and jazz. As something completely new to me, it's exciting and has shown me the fun of percussion instruments.

                    Writing this on my plane to San Francisco; maybe it's the fact that Americans are, on average, much bigger than I am, but this United flight feels
                    more spacious than I'm used to. The Boeing 777 might be my new favourite plane to ride!
                    <br>
                    Praying to the ancestors of both sides of my family before departing, I realised just how religious I can be, even when I am a self-described 
                    agnostic, usually non-religious. What is considered religious in the West might be considered superstitious in Japan, but praying to ancestors 
                    probably counts as a religious act, especially when it's in front of a proper Buddhist altar. Maybe what I consider to be superstitious might 
                    just be an extremely decentralized religion? Anyways, I prayed for my ancestors to look over me and to protect my luggage from being damaged 
                    on my flight. Here's hoping they answer my prayers (I don't know if that's how it works).
                    <br>
                    I've noticed how I've been finding it more and more difficult to sleep on flights recently, I hope I can find a way to overcome this, or my future 
                    travel plans might be in jeopardy. Something intersting I've noticed is how I feel sleepier with hyperflip and other louder genres than relaxing 
                    music. Maybe the auditory overstimulation might actually help me sleep? Regardless, I've got to get myself an eye mask and some melatonin (or is it 
                    melanin?) for my next flight.

                    Another full month of no updates... I might just be bad at blogging.
                    <br>
                    August was full of events; I embarked on a two-week trip to the People's Republic of China, visiting 5 cities (Shanghai, Wuzhen, Hangzhou, 
                    Nanjing, Bejing) and gorging myself on the delicious food available. The image above is of the Great Wall of China, which was more tiring than 
                    expected to walk through. I didn't realize it would be so vertical, but it is, after all, built on top of mountains.
                    <br>
                    I also went on a 9-hour, 100km trip around Lake Kasumigaura, the second-largest lake in Japan. Exhausting, but really fun to do with friends; I'd 
                    recommend going early in the morning so you don't have to worry about the sun setting.
                    <br>
                    Packing my personal belongings right now to prepare for my trip to the US, I'm somewhat surprised that all my belongings fit in 2 suitcases + 
                    my guitar.

                    I've been going outside a lot recently, whether it be to the CLAMP exhibition (pic related), the graves of relatives, or a friend's DJ event. 
                    <br>
                    The CLAMP exhibition was amazing, with so many original color illustrations and manga panels on show. I was able to see artwork from my favourite
                    CLAMP works like Cardcaptor Sakura, Chobits, and Kobato, along with a few illustrations from related works like Code Geass.
                    <br>
                    Going to the cemetery was a relaxing experience, talking with relatives about the time spent with (recently) deceased family members. The cemetery
                    itself was beautiful and quiet, with a relaxing atmosphere, even in the Tokyo summer.
                    <br>
                    I'd never been to a DJ event before, and although it was in a relatively small club, the flashing lights and the loud music was very overstimulating.
                    I really enjoyed it, and I'd love to go again.

                    I've... been ignoring this website (and this blog) for the last 5 months. Consistency-wise, not off to a good start.
                    <br>
                    I've finished reading Yagate Kimi Ni Naru, and I've completed Angel Beats and Attack on Titan during these five months. YagaKimi is awesome, and 
                    has made me reconsider how I frame things, and whether I'm just running away from my insecurities and troubles or not.
                    I've also finished the book, "The Structure of the Japanese Consiousness" (rough translation) by Aida Yuji.
                    <br>
                    The image here is from a recent 4am excursion to the Pacific Ocean off of Chiba - I was aiming to look at the sunrise, but the foggy sandbanks
                    made for a very tranquil view (more about tranquility in today's Thoughts update.) I think I'll try to add an image with every blog post fron now on,
                    as it'll make for a more "aesthetic" webpage (and to compensate for the wider span between blog posts.)

                    These past few days have been a 8/10. I spent my time buying souveniers, going on a safari at Etosha National Park, and am writing this on my plane back to Japan.
                <br>
                    I don't remember what i ate, but something of note is the fact this is the first blog post on here that contains an image! I'll try and add more in my upcoming entries, although they may be less frequent.
                <br>
                    I've started reading Vasily Grossman's <i>Life and Fate</i> again, hopefully I'll be able to read through it soon.

                    Today was a 6/10. I woke up at noon, and spent the afternoon setting up Syncthing on my ThinkPad, to sync my photos and music with my phone and other laptop. I was about halfway done with the 120gb synchronization transfer (at 2MiB/s) when I realized that I could just transfer everything through a cable, then let it sync with Syncthing from there. 
                <br>
                    Lunch consisted of butter chicken curry, and dinner was chicken/onion hamburg (Japanese-style), along with 蓮根、蒟蒻と鶏肉の煮物.
                <br>
                    I need to write e-mails and prepare for going back to Japan, and I think I'll go buy souveniers tomorrow.
                <br>
                    Interested in increasing my capability to daydream/imagine ideas and scenarios in my head. What comes to mind the most are the Sea of Lilies scene from the Chronicles of Narnia, and the forest with the ponds that each travel to their own world (also from Narnia!). The tranquility is just really appealing to me, maybe because I feel like my surroundings are so busy (even though they really aren't).
                <br>
                    I'm also interested in the book 陰翳礼讃, I might read it to get a better understanding of my home culture before I go abroad.

                    Today was a 5/10. I woke up at noon, and spent the afternoon on discord/instagram talking to friends, about what souveniers from Namibia to get them. In the evening, I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">learned</a> how to use GitHub, and created this website. 
                <br>
                    Lunch consisted of egg fried rice and sichuan boiled beef (水煮牛肉), and dinner was sundubu, japchae, and spicy potatoes.
                <br>
                    I should utilize my time more efficiently, reading the <a href="https://www.jpicinternational.com/books/history/98272d6bed3984f0641b4fd803195591a3089df9.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="The Tokyo Trial: War Criminals and Japan's Postwar International Relations, by Higurashi Yoshinobu">book</a> I've been interested in, for example.
                <br>
                    I don't have anything of note to write here today. I guess if I were to just write freely, I'm currently lightly obsessed over <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/37786/Yagate_Kimi_ni_Naru" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Yuu is so cute yet relatable...">Yagate Kimi Ni Naru</a>, because wow, the anime was good. I should read the manga soon.
