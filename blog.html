                    I've been going outside a lot recently, whether it be to the CLAMP exhibition (pic related), the graves of relatives, or a friend's DJ event. 
                    <br>
                    The CLAMP exhibition was amazing, with so many original color illustrations and manga panels on show. I was able to see artwork from my favourite
                    CLAMP works like Cardcaptor Sakura, Chobits, and Kobato, along with a few illustrations from related works like Code Geass.
                    <br>
                    Going to the cemetery was a relaxing experience, talking with relatives about the time spent with (recently) deceased family members. The cemetery
                    itself was beautiful and quiet, with a relaxing atmosphere, even in the Tokyo summer.
                    <br>
                    I'd never been to a DJ event before, and although it was in a relatively small club, the flashing lights and the loud music was very overstimulating.
                    I really enjoyed it, and I'd love to go again.

                    I've... been ignoring this website (and this blog) for the last 5 months. Consistency-wise, not off to a good start.
                    <br>
                    I've finished reading Yagate Kimi Ni Naru, and I've completed Angel Beats and Attack on Titan during these five months. YagaKimi is awesome, and 
                    has made me reconsider how I frame things, and whether I'm just running away from my insecurities and troubles or not.
                    I've also finished the book, "The Structure of the Japanese Consiousness" (rough translation) by Aida Yuji.
                    <br>
                    The image here is from a recent 4am excursion to the Pacific Ocean off of Chiba - I was aiming to look at the sunrise, but the foggy sandbanks
                    made for a very tranquil view (more about tranquility in today's Thoughts update.) I think I'll try to add an image with every blog post fron now on,
                    as it'll make for a more "aesthetic" webpage (and to compensate for the wider span between blog posts.)

                    These past few days have been a 8/10. I spent my time buying souveniers, going on a safari at Etosha National Park, and am writing this on my plane back to Japan.
                <br>
                    I don't remember what i ate, but something of note is the fact this is the first blog post on here that contains an image! I'll try and add more in my upcoming entries, although they may be less frequent.
                <br>
                    I've started reading Vasily Grossman's <i>Life and Fate</i> again, hopefully I'll be able to read through it soon.

                    Today was a 6/10. I woke up at noon, and spent the afternoon setting up Syncthing on my ThinkPad, to sync my photos and music with my phone and other laptop. I was about halfway done with the 120gb synchronization transfer (at 2MiB/s) when I realized that I could just transfer everything through a cable, then let it sync with Syncthing from there. 
                <br>
                    Lunch consisted of butter chicken curry, and dinner was chicken/onion hamburg (Japanese-style), along with 蓮根、蒟蒻と鶏肉の煮物.
                <br>
                    I need to write e-mails and prepare for going back to Japan, and I think I'll go buy souveniers tomorrow.
                <br>
                    Interested in increasing my capability to daydream/imagine ideas and scenarios in my head. What comes to mind the most are the Sea of Lilies scene from the Chronicles of Narnia, and the forest with the ponds that each travel to their own world (also from Narnia!). The tranquility is just really appealing to me, maybe because I feel like my surroundings are so busy (even though they really aren't).
                <br>
                    I'm also interested in the book 陰翳礼讃, I might read it to get a better understanding of my home culture before I go abroad.

                    Today was a 5/10. I woke up at noon, and spent the afternoon on discord/instagram talking to friends, about what souveniers from Namibia to get them. In the evening, I <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">learned</a> how to use GitHub, and created this website. 
                <br>
                    Lunch consisted of egg fried rice and sichuan boiled beef (水煮牛肉), and dinner was sundubu, japchae, and spicy potatoes.
                <br>
                    I should utilize my time more efficiently, reading the <a href="https://www.jpicinternational.com/books/history/98272d6bed3984f0641b4fd803195591a3089df9.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="The Tokyo Trial: War Criminals and Japan's Postwar International Relations, by Higurashi Yoshinobu">book</a> I've been interested in, for example.
                <br>
                    I don't have anything of note to write here today. I guess if I were to just write freely, I'm currently lightly obsessed over <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/37786/Yagate_Kimi_ni_Naru" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Yuu is so cute yet relatable...">Yagate Kimi Ni Naru</a>, because wow, the anime was good. I should read the manga soon.
