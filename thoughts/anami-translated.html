                        A classic r/HistoryMemes post
                    </a>
                    : oversimplified, sourcing Wikipedia, and of questionable veracity. In this case, the meme is referencing August 9th 
                    1945, and Anami Korechika's words during the Imperial Conference that took place that night. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    The topic of the conference was on how many conditions Japan should attach to their surrender to the Allies, and the Japanese cabinet was at a 
                    deadlock. Three members were for a surrender with one precondition, being the preservation of the Emperor as head of state. The other three were 
                    for a surrender with three additional preconditions; the sentencing of Japan's war criminals internally, the independent demilitarisation of the 
                    Japanese military, and a guarantee of no Allied occupation on the mainland. Precluding this, the three stated, Japan should reject any surrender 
                    and fight until its destruction. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Anami was in the latter camp. In this context, during the Imperial Conference, he protested against the adoption of the former camp's position. 
                    Among his words was the following:
                </p>
                <p class="quote">
                    “...But even if the enemy repeats his thrusts and we cannot repel him, would it not be wondrous for this whole nation to be destroyed like a 
                    beautiful flower, leaving for this world's posterity only the great name of Japan and its brave, noble history? Would it not be glorious to be 
                    remembered as a people who refused to submit? Would it not be far better than surrendering ignominiously to our enemies?"
                </p>
                <p> 
                    His words here, especially, "...would it not be wondrous for this whole nation to be destroyed like a flower...?" have been popularised in the 
                    western discussion of this moment, being liked by thousands on platforms such as Reddit's r/HistoryMemes and r/NonCredibleDefense. It is also in 
                    the

                    for "Surrender of Japan".
                </p>
                <p> 
                    There's only one issue: there isn't any mention of Anami mentioning this phrase in Japanese sources.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This phrase is attributed to a book called 
                    <i><a href="https://archive.org/details/imperialtragedyj00coff/page/349/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                        Imperial Tragedy
                    </a></i>
                    , by Thomas M. Coffey. While Thomas M. Coffey is an author of multiple books on history, he is not a historian; rather, alongside serving in the 
                    Air Force in WWII, his main profession was as a journalist and a television producer. He also primarily relied on translated sources for his book.
                </p>
                <p>
                    As such, I was already quite doubtful of the quote, and I decided to look into the Japanese sources from the end of the war to try and corroborate 
                    it.

                    One of the definitive collection of Japanese sources around the end of the Pacific theatre of WWII is the <i>Shusenshiroku</i> (終戦史録) published by 
                    the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in 1952. A compilation of Japanese sources, it gives various perspectives on the WWII-era Japanese government, 
                    through a lens without the historical revisionism that has permeated parts of the Japanese government and politics afterwards. This compendium 
                    covers the Imperial Conference on August 9th, 1945, and gives a number of sources.

                    Among these, there is no metaphor of flowers mentioned. Coffey's account is similar enough to Sakomizu's to believe that his account is likely 
                    sourced from a translated text of Sakomizu's version of events. 
                </p>
                <p>Assuming this is true, I find it plausible that the oft-quoted section,
                </p>
                <p class="quote">
                    “...for this whole nation to be destroyed like a beautiful flower"
                </p>
                <p>comes from a mistranslation of the phrase 「一億玉砕」. A phrase that reflected the official sentiment of the glory of martyrdom for Japan and the 
                    Emperor, it can be translated as “for the whole country to be destroyed like jades”. I believe that somewhere along the line, one of 
                    Coffey's sources mistranslated “jade” as “flower”, and hence the quote was born.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Does this matter? Obviously, Anami's original statements did advocate for a suicidal final battle on the mainland, and he would have likely agreed 
                    with this quote (if we placed the matter of how to best translate this into Japanese aside). However, the fact that this likely mistranslation has 
                    become so popularised in western ideas of Anami is a distortion of history, and should be corrected. 
                </p>
                <p>Looking at things from a larger perspective, misquotes and misrepresentations of history can be a large issue in general, and they don't even always 
                    arise from mistranslations. I find

                    by Rosencreuts to be relevant, and one of the reasons why 
                    I bothered to look into this topic in the first place.

                <p>
                    Regardless of their significance, it's better to doubt unverifiable “truths” than to stay ignorant of the potential pitfalls in our 
                    understanding of history.
