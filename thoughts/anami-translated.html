                    Nature, as I perceive it, is a noun to describe something that has become exceptionally rare, if it still exists at all. 
                    <br>
                    A state of pristine wilderness, an untouched unknown, some <i>other</i> which we know not of.
                    <br>
                    Nature, as I perceive it, has ceased to be.
                </p>
                <p>
                    …
                </p>
                <p>
                    Known as a bastion of nature, Etosha National Park, located in northern Namibia, was my final destination in a month-long trip to the country. 
                    <i>The Land of the Brave</i>, as the nation calls itself, has the world's second-lowest population density; my goal there was to experience its 
                    untouched landscapes, its awe-inspiring wilderness, the nature of it all. And upon first glance, it was difficult to say I hadn't done exactly that. 
                    The towering sand dunes surrounding the coastal city of Swakopmund, the ancient granite monoliths of Spitzkoppe, the centuries-old quiver “trees” 
                    (a type of aloe) on the outskirts of Keetmanshoop - my itinieary was filled with natural wonders, of views carved over millions of years, what most 
                    would think of when asked to imagine natural scenery. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    And yet, although I couldn't place it, something felt <i>off</i> about the “nature” I'd experienced. The seemingly neverending dunes of the Namib 
                    Desert were a fresh relief from the man-made concrete and glass hellscape that comprises Metropolitan Tokyo, but I felt like I hadn't truly escaped 
                    the confines of man-made society, that I hadn't really seen nature. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    The guidebook to Etosha contained the answer to this vague issue I was so contrived over. Designated a national park in 1907, Etosha has has 
                    extensive alterations to its natural state since the first German explorers surveyed the territory. With multiple artifical boreholes dug to provide 
                    year-round water within the confines of the park, and the entirety of the park fenced in, the result has been the elimination of the massive seasonal 
                    migration of animals present in other regions such as Okavango. Additionally, with the development of thousands of kilometres of gravel roads in the 
                    park, the once unabashedly savage land has been tamed and dometicated into a patchwork of small terriotires, divided by one of the most distinct 
                    signs of human activity. Etosha is not natural; it is essentially a massive, self-sustaining zoo.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    Of course I hadn't felt like I'd truly been experiencing “nature” - the locations I visited were no longer natural! The fenced off dunes, the paths 
                    cleared and chains embedded in Spitzkoppe, the entry fee to view the quiver trees - every location on my trip was merely a fascimile of nature, 
                    meticulously curated to give visiters the facade of what the desired. The epitome of artificiality, these locations cater to the artifical construct 
                    imprinted on expectant visitors fed to them by the media, and in turn, the media highlights these exploited curios as the last bastions of what the 
                    ascribe as “true nature”. A neverending sprial of media imprinting and confirmation, the duplicity of these locations as idealized escapes, which in 
                    reality are firmly within the confines of artificial reality; I had been fooled. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    ...
                </p>
                <p>
                    What, then, should we do to really experience nature? 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Nature may only remain within the stars; within the far-flung planets which we can only observe.
