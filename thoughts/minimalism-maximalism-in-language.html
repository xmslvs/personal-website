                <p>
                    “Oh, this peculiar instrument of Man, this symbol of Civilization, this divine miracle: the ink-blotting, paper-scratching, subject-sketching tool 
                    before me is, in English parlance, known as the pen.”
                </p>
                <p>
                    I recently watched <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OrsbAAv65z4" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">this video</a> by David Perell, 
                    and was interested by his interviewee, The Cultural Tutor, and his takes on maximalism and minimalism in language. His view, in summary, is that 
                    modern writing is very minimalist, in line with the advent of minimalism in the 20th century; this change has reduced the personality, nuance, and 
                    depth of language possible, while increasing reading efficiency and clarity, when compared to more maximalist styles of writing, largely found in 
                    older pieces of literature. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I found this distinction to be interesting, partly because this had partly explained the strangeness I’d felt as a child with the way English 
                    writing was taught to me. “<i>No run-on sentences, no long paragraphs, as clear and concise as possible!</i>” It was almost as if my English teachers had 
                    wanted me to limit myself to a narrower breadth of expression, to keep my writing within a box of “acceptable writing”, and I’d found myself 
                    disagreeing with that notion.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Why wouldn’t run-on sentences be acceptable, given their capability to achieve a certain type of effect, of a peculiar rambling, of which that 
                    nuance would be lost if broken up, and be lost to the wind? 
                </p>
                <p>
                    Rules on long paragraphs made even less sense: to articulate a point well, sometimes one requires more than five lines in a paragraph. To limit a 
                    child like that, limits their options to freely dictate what they wish to inform the reader of. Sometimes, one just has to stay on a topic for an 
                    extended length: perhaps their true thesis requires context to be understood, perhaps their ideas are too complex for five lines on A4 paper to 
                    suffice, perhaps they wish to use flowery sentences filled with simile and metaphor, like a bee collecting nectar they buzz from one point to the 
                    next, in a delightfully drowsy and slow laze, moving with purpose but without rush: the point is, to place arbitrary bounds on one’s writing is to 
                    constrain oneself in a terribly wasteful manner, the creative loss of which harms and damages the literary development of a child’s writing. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    And finally, conciseness and clarity, while deemed so important by the all-important, ever-busy, productive, efficient systems of our society, 
                    should not be the metrics a child considers important when learning to write. Ridding our children of their voices, their abilities to speak for 
                    themselves, and conforming them to an industrial standard of minimalist voices, of which only the poets rebel against, should that truly be our 
                    goal in education? Would it not be better to facilitate the development of our children’s minds, their ability to record and recall the nuance and 
                    beauty of life in the way they deem fit, the birth of new idioms, new phrases, new prose?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Please surmise for yourself what I meant to convey, for just as I disliked the constraints on sentence and paragraphs, I disliked the strictly 
                    enforced, standard five-paragraph essay structure as well.
