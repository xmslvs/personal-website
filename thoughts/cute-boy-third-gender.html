The "Cute Boy" Third Gender

What do the traditional gender identities signify to me?

This question has been hounding me for quite some time now. While I self-describe as a male, I am interested in cute, feminine things. From looking cute to acting
cute, I wish to <b>act</b> "girlish". However, I do not wish to <b>be</b> a girl, and I am firmly male in my gender identity, or so I believe.

With the increased expectations placed among men in society, I do not believe I am the only one that feels this way. With men expected to perform both their traditional 
roles as breadwinners alongisde new expectations of being homemakers as well, this increased labor makes achieveing this ideal increasingly difficult. This gap between 
my capabiliites and the current male ideal has made it hard to identify with the mainstream image of what a man should be. On the other hand, the same reasons of increased 
expectations has turned me away from idealizing becoming a woman either, and I do not feel as though either of the mainstream images of the gender binary properly convey 
what I wish to be. Instead, I believe that I, alongside an increasing number of men, now desire to step out of the binary, and to become "boyfailures"; that is, the wish 
to simply be accepted even without the capability of fulfilling all the demanding expectations of the modern male ideal. To this extent, I believe these men adopt a 
"girly", more feminine persona, along with some degree of self-infantilization, to signal to others. through our common problematic tropes of women and children, 
their self-perceived helplessness. The recent popularity of self-feminizing and infantilizing memes such as "boykisser", "pookie" and "this could be us" mmmes are, I 
feel, a byproduct of the proliferation of this "boyfailure" identity among cisgender, heterosexual men. 
What has caused this spread?
I believe that the explosive spread of these "boyfailures" comes from the development of the abiltity to talk with strangers anonymously and safely, i.e. Discord. 
Platforms such as Discord, which allow text messaging, and crucially, real-world anonymity while allowing people to express their identity through profiles, has allowed 
people to cultivate identities that may not align with what one would tradiitonally perceive them to have from their physical appearance, as their digital appearance 
(their profile) now supplants thier physical appearance with regards to how they manifest themselves to others. This makes it much easier to convey an identity, as it is 
now possible to change your outwards idenity with the press of a few button and changing a few images, rather than overhauling your entire wardrobe.
Platfoms like Discord also allow poeple to explore changes to their identity in an environment safer than traditionally possible. People are allowed to act how they 
wish without fear of being called a faggot and shamed for the rest of thier lives in real life: this fear of shame has historically been a big factor in preserving 
the traiditonal gender binary. 
With these two changes, it is easier to change and explore identity than ever before. This increased accessibiilty has lead to a proliferation of men, whom may have 
tradiitonally been pressured into adopting a "masculine" identity, forgoing that in favor of a "boyfailure"-type persona. This break from traditional gender ideals, 
while largely contained to online platforms (due to the aforementioned, continued difficulty of changing identities in real life), has, in some sense, spread to real-world 
relationships as well.
Even within real-world relationships, the spread of messaging applications like Discord or Instagram has allowed for an increased layer of obfuscation to develop, an additional 
layer of ambiguousness that allows one to eplore their identity while hiding behind a mask of plausible deniability (i.e. "im just joking", "im being ironic"). Depnding 
on your friend group, one can now send Instagram Reels of femboys with the caption, "me when I see you :333", to a friend without any reprisal, and this signifies the 
growing mainstream acceptance of these types of men. 
With the increasingly faster adoption and discarding of identity, we now live in a sort of Identity Renaissance; we are likely freer than ever in our ability to explore 
changing who we are, or what we consider ourselves to be. While this does have its drawbacks, like being used by brands to center your identity around a product or 
franchise (link cckphilosophy buzzfeed lacan video here), it's never been easier to explore what you truly wish to be, what you truly want. So next time you see a cute 
video in your feed, maybe send it to a friend or two, to help spread this wave of acceptance.
