                    What significance do the traditional gender identities have?
                </p>
                <p>
                    This question has been hounding me for quite some time now. While I self-identify as a male, I am interested in cute, feminine things. From looking 
                    cute to acting cute, I wish to <b>act</b> "girlish". However, I do not wish to <b>be</b> a girl, and I am firmly male in my gender identity, or so 
                    I believe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the increased expectations placed among men in society, I do not believe I am the only one that feels this way. With men expected to perform 
                    both their traditional roles as breadwinners alongisde new expectations of being homemakers as well, this increased labor makes achieveing this 
                    ideal increasingly difficult. This gap between my capabiliites and the current male ideal has made it hard to identify with the mainstream image 
                    of what a man should be. On the other hand, the same reasons of increased expectations has turned me away from idealizing becoming a woman either, 
                    and I do not feel as though either of the mainstream images of the gender binary properly convey what I wish to be. Instead, I believe that I, 
                    alongside an increasing number of men, now desire to step out of the binary, and to become "boyfailures"; that is, the wish to simply be accepted 
                    even without the capability of fulfilling all the demanding expectations of the modern male ideal. To this extent, I believe these men adopt a 
                    "girly", more feminine persona, along with some degree of self-infantilization, to signal to others. through our common problematic tropes of women 
                    and children, their self-perceived helplessness. The recent popularity of self-feminizing and infantilizing memes such as "boykisser", "pookie" and 
                    "this could be us" mmmes are, I feel, a byproduct of the proliferation of this "boyfailure" identity among cisgender, heterosexual men. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    What has caused this spread?
                </p>
                <p>
                    I believe that the explosive spread of these "boyfailures" comes from the development of the abiltity to talk with strangers anonymously and 
                    safely, i.e. Discord. Platforms such as Discord, which allow text messaging, and crucially, real-world anonymity while allowing people to express 
                    their identity through profiles, has allowed people to cultivate identities that may not align with what one would tradiitonally perceive them to 
                    have from their physical appearance, as their digital appearance (their profile) now supplants thier physical appearance with regards to how they 
                    manifest themselves to others. This makes it much easier to convey an identity, as it is now possible to change your outwards idenity with the 
                    press of a few button and changing a few images, rather than overhauling your entire wardrobe.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Platfoms like Discord also allow poeple to explore changes to their identity in an environment safer than traditionally possible. People are 
                    allowed to act how they wish without fear of being called a faggot and shamed for the rest of thier lives in real life: this fear of shame has 
                    historically been a big factor in preserving the traiditonal gender binary. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    With these two changes, it is easier to change and explore identity than ever before. This increased accessibiilty has lead to a proliferation of 
                    men, whom may have tradiitonally been pressured into adopting a "masculine" identity, forgoing that in favor of a "boyfailure"-type persona. This 
                    break from traditional gender ideals, while largely contained to online platforms (due to the aforementioned, continued difficulty of changing 
                    identities in real life), has, in some sense, spread to real-world relationships as well.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Even within real-world relationships, the spread of messaging applications like Discord or Instagram has allowed for an increased layer of 
                    obfuscation to develop, an additional layer of ambiguousness that allows one to eplore their identity while hiding behind a mask of plausible 
                    deniability (i.e. "im just joking", "im being ironic"). Depnding on your friend group, one can now send Instagram Reels of femboys with the 
                    caption, "me when I see you :333", to a friend without any reprisal, and this signifies the growing mainstream acceptance of these types of men. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    With the increasingly faster adoption and discarding of identity, we now live in a sort of Identity Renaissance; we are likely freer than ever in 
                    our ability to explore changing who we are, or what we consider ourselves to be. While this does have its drawbacks, like being used by brands to 
                    center your identity around a product or franchise (link cckphilosophy buzzfeed lacan video here), it's never been easier to explore what you truly
                    wish to be, what you truly want. So next time you see a cute video in your feed, maybe send it to a friend or two, to help spread this wave of 
                    acceptance.
