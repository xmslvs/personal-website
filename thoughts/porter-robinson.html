                        “… I think the whole idea of like, a beautiful apocalypse is really evocative to me. I love that. Y'know, this isn't a 
                        zombie death thing here, this is, this is like pretty, y'know? This is... a beautiful world kind of disappearing in a

                    , a YouTube video released on October 18, 2016, has continued to be one of my favorite pieces of short media for over 
                    seven years. Six-minutes of animation from A-1 Pictures alongside an original track by Porter Robinson and Madeon, it has 
                    amassed over 83 million views.

                        “Shelter tells the story of Rin, a 17-year-old girl who lives her life inside of a futuristic simulation completely by 
                        herself in infinite, beautiful loneliness. Each day, Rin awakens in virtual reality and uses a tablet which controls the 
                        simulation to create a new, different, beautiful world for herself. Until one day, everything changes, and Rin comes to 
                        learn the true origins behind her life inside a simulation.”

                    The description undersells the emotions that this video evoked in me. In a way few other pieces of media have been able to 
                    evoke since, this video masterfully strikes the ideas of comfortable desolateness, confined wanderlust, and beautiful 
                    apocalypse.
                </p>
                <p> 
                    <b>Comfortable Desolateness</b> - The feeling of being alone, in a vast, lifeless space, with absolute assuredness of your safety. 
                    Similar feelings: Taking a walk outside late at night, transiting overnight in an empty airport alone, watching the sunset 
                    on a quiet beach, private VRChat worlds. The feeling of comfort you get whilst being in unfamiliar, empty environments, the 
                    vastness you feel without any fear or nervousness. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    <b>Confined Wanderlust</b> - The feeling that you can do anything, whilst being confined in a room or space. Similar feelings: 
                    being online during COVID, late-night Discord calls. A feeling which mixes escapism and creativity, the contrast between 
                    your physical and mental states, the pent-up physical energy you use for your mind instead. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <b>Beautiful Apocalypse</b> - A beautiful end of the world, without prolonged pain, anguish, or suffering. A romanticisation of 
                    ending it all. Not necessarily suicidal; a passive resignation to an ending. Similar feelings: The tide washing away 
                    footprints, closing the final page of a book, the final day of school. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    <i>Shelter</i> brings these feelings to the forefront, inviting you into a state of melancholy, reminiscing of times long past 
                    that you can no longer change, that start to feel comforting in hindsight. Feeling both trapped and infinitely free, it 
                    lets you explore both scopes of your mind to the fullest. <i>Shelter</i> was what inspired me to start daydreaming more, to 
                    imagine worlds that could be, solely to feel emotions that are difficult to feel otherwise. This has led me to embrace 
                    <a href="/personal-website/thoughts/tranquility.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
                        tranquility
                    </a>, and it's not an overstatement to say that <i>Shelter</i> helped me develop my ability to reflect.
