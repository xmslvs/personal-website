                    Interested in increasing my capability to daydream/imagine ideas and scenarios in my head. What comes to mind the most are the Sea of Lilies scene from the Chronicles of Narnia, and the forest with the ponds that each travel to their own world (also from Narnia!). The tranquility is just really appealing to me, maybe because I feel like my surroundings are so busy (even though they really aren't).
                    <br>
                    I'm also interested in learning Chinese intensively before September, maybe through a month at a language school or so? I'm not sure how much I'd improve in such a relatively short period, though.
                    <br>
                    I'm also interested in the book 陰翳礼讃, I might read it to get a better understanding of my home culture before I go abroad.

                    I don't have anything of note to write here today. I guess if I were to just write freely, I'm currently lightly obsessed over <a href="https://myanimelist.net/anime/37786/Yagate_Kimi_ni_Naru" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" title="Yuu is so cute yet relatable...">Yagate Kimi Ni Naru</a>>, because wow, the anime was good. I should read the manga soon.
